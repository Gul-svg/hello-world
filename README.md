# hello-world
my test-first repository of git
now i hope i can learn git easily with hands on some practical work. before, it seemed something imposible for  me to learn- just reading articles and watching videos. hence, it is proven that doing is far more worthy then just reading or watching. Thank you Github developers for providing the Guide which stresses on working simultinously with reading.
